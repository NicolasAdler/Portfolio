# STI Estimator App

A practical tool for acoustics professionals and enthusiasts to quickly estimate the **Speech Transmission Index (STI)** and reverberation characteristics of a room based on surface materials and dimensions.

## Overview

The **STI Estimator App** allows users to input key acoustic surfaces of a room, assign material properties, and instantly generate estimates for:

- **Reverberation Time (RT60) at 500 Hz**
- **Speech Transmission Index (STI)**
- **Total Absorption of the room**
- **Articulation Loss Percentage (AL%)**

This tool streamlines early-stage acoustic analysis, helping you evaluate room intelligibility and absorption characteristics efficiently.

## Features

- **Dynamic Surface Table Generation**: Input the number of surfaces and generate a table where each surface can be named, sized, and assigned absorption coefficients.  
- **Automatic Calculations**: Once all surface data is entered, the app computes **RT60**, **STI**, total room absorption, and **AL%**.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for quick entry and clear visualization of results.

## How to Use

1. Enter the **number of important surfaces** in the room.  
2. Click **Generate Table**.  
3. For each surface, enter:
   - Name (e.g., "Ceiling", "Wall A")  
   - Dimensions (length, width, or area as applicable)  
   - Absorption coefficient (per frequency band, typically at 500 Hz)  
4. Click **Enter** to calculate results.  
5. View the **RT60**, **STI**, **Total Absorption**, and **Articulation Loss %**.  

## Example Workflow

1. Input 4 surfaces.  
2. Name them: "Ceiling", "Floor", "North Wall", "South Wall".  
3. Enter dimensions and absorption coefficients.  
4. Click **Enter**.  
5. Results display:
   - **RT60** = 0.8 s  
   - **STI** = 0.62  
   - **Total Absorption** = 45 m² Sabine  
   - **AL%** = 18%  

## Requirements

- MATLAB or Python (depending on your implementation)  
- GUI support for table input (e.g., MATLAB App Designer, PyQt, Tkinter)  

## Potential Extensions

- Multi-frequency STI estimation  
- Incorporation of scattering coefficients for more accurate modeling  
- Export results to Excel or PDF  
- Visualization of absorption distribution in the room
